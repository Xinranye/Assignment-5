Reviewer1:
1.The app run on my emulator, so your code is fine.
2. You use tap as navigation, which is simple and easy to use. 
3. The color fits well and your detail format is nice. But you can add some space between title and information in detail page.
4. I do not know how to make a business card, but I remember Lori said we can add some work history or project we ever did, that's 
   the only thing I can suggest you to improve regard as your content. 
5. it works on android phone but not work on tablet. The similar code of another person works on both devices. It is super strange.

You did a good job!
